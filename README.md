# Memintos_Project

Memintos is a mission-driven, community-based platform on the Cardano blockchain. 

While many new decentralized apps (dApps) and technical innovations are emerging on Cardano that seek to revolutionize how we do all sorts of things, our quest is to commemorate this collective journey and to do so by allowing people to participate in the immortalization of this ecosystem’s development.

Our mission is best formatted in the following question that we are in the pursuit of answering:

**What can we do to make people interested in or to care about the history, future and current news of Cardano, and how do we get them to remember?**

There may be many different answers and viable approaches here; the direction we are currently moving in is best described by our very name. Memintos is a play on both "momentos" for objects of remembrance and tributes to the past and "mint" in that the mementos on this platform are in the form of minted digital assets on the Cardano blockchain. *Mementos + Mint = Memintos !*

The basic gist: we will catalogue the history, anticipated future and current milestone news of Cardano and airdrop limited-edition tokens of a different mint for each event that are available only for a limited window around the actual milestone’s occurrence. Additional nuances may come into play as further answers to our mission question may be compatible to implement here, such as having social games being played that involve the tokens.


**Some Key Challenges / Questions to Consider:**

How do we make a token-incentivized ecosystem of remembrance as accessible as possible to everyone (after all, minting and transactions aren’t free)?

How do we make the content and the modes of engagement as accessible as possible to everyone (when different audiences each have their own levels of understanding and motivations; layman enthusiast vs seasoned developer)?

As IOHK becomes less centralized in the Cardano roadmap over time, how do we keep up with all of the progress being made globally, how do we decide what things to focus on commemorating and who participates in that decision-making?

How do we deal with multiple interpretations of an event or the evolution of that event’s meaning and significance over time, especially after it has been commemorated (as its impact is more apparent or when more information behind it becomes public)? For example, some milestone event could be hailed as the greatest thing ever as it emerges but then later, we find it out it actually lead to a catastrophe (and thus won’t be remembered as the “greatest thing ever”)?
